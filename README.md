# vscode-open-files-in-directory 

A vscode extension to open a directory-load of files. 

## Features

This extension adds the option to the file explorer (and the command options, accessed with ctrl + shift + p, or cmd + shift + p on mac), to open all the files in the directory. If the selected item is a file it selects the parent directory, if its a directory it'll use that directory.


Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
